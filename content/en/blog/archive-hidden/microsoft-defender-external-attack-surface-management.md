**Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (EASM)** is a security solution for an organization's external attack surfaces. It operates by monitoring security and operational integrity across the following assets:

- Websites
- IP addresses
- Domains
- SSL certificates
- Other digital assets

In addition to these components, EASM can also forward all relevant information and logs to SIEM solutions such as Microsoft Sentinel.

It is also possible to manually input company-specific data, such as all domain names and IP addresses associated with its services.

The costs for this solution are minimal; you pay €0.01 per day per host, domain, or IP address added. For example, I configured it with **10 instances of each**, resulting in a total monthly cost of **€9.17**. The costs are billed on your Azure invoice.
