  When using Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) or Windows (W365), we sometimes use the mobile apps for Android, MacOS or iOS. But those apps rely on filling in a Feed Discovery URL instead of simply a Email address and a password.

Did you know we can automate this process? I will explain how to do this!

Fast path for URL: https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/api/arm/feeddiscovery

## The problem explained

When downloading the apps for your mobile devices, we get this window after installing:

[![jv-media-4725-cbe412d3fee2.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/automatic-avd-w365-feed-discovery-for-mobile-apps-4725/jv-media-4725-cbe412d3fee2.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/automatic-avd-w365-feed-discovery-for-mobile-apps-4725/jv-media-4725-cbe412d3fee2.png)

After filling in our emailadress that has access to a Azure Virtual Desktop hostpool or Windows 365 machine, we still get this error:

- *We couldn't find any Workspaces associated with this email address. Try providing a URL instead.*

Now the client wants a URL, but we don't want to fill in this URL for every device we configure. We can automate this through DNS.

## How to configure the Feed Discovery DNS record

To configure your automatic Feed Discovery, we must create this DNS record:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Record type** | **Host** | **Value** |
| TXT | \_msradc | https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/api/arm/feeddiscovery |

Small note, we must configure this record for every domain which is used for one of the 2 remote desktop solutions. If your company uses e.g.:

- justinverstijnen.nl
- justinverstijnen.com
- justinverstijnen.tech

We must configure this 3 times.

Let's login to our DNS hosting for the domain, and create the record:

[![jv-media-4725-4d1ba0d66799.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/automatic-avd-w365-feed-discovery-for-mobile-apps-4725/jv-media-4725-4d1ba0d66799.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/automatic-avd-w365-feed-discovery-for-mobile-apps-4725/jv-media-4725-4d1ba0d66799.png)

Then save your configuration and wait for a few minutes.

## Let's test the configuration

Now that our DNS record is in place, we can test this by again, typing our email address into the application:

[![jv-media-4725-ba13d135b117.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/automatic-avd-w365-feed-discovery-for-mobile-apps-4725/jv-media-4725-ba13d135b117.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/automatic-avd-w365-feed-discovery-for-mobile-apps-4725/jv-media-4725-ba13d135b117.png)

Now the application automatically finds the domain and imports the feed discovery URL into the application. This minor change solves a lot of headache.

---

## Summary

Creating this DNS record saves a lot of problems and headache for users and administrators of Azure Virtual Desktop and/or Windows 365. I hope I explained clearly how to configure this record and described the problem.
